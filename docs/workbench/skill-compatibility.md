# Skill compatibility

- Status: accepted implementation contract
- Last verified: 2026-08-05

## Outcome

Use the open Agent Skills directory format as tenon's portable skill source:

```text
skills/
  code-review/
    SKILL.md
    scripts/
    references/
    assets/
    agents/
      openai.yaml
```

This is a hard cut from the provisional `skills/*.md` convention. There is no
dual-format loader or authored tenon manifest. The standard defines portable
packaging; a harness extension is honored only when the selected harness
documents that exact behavior. Tenon preserves recognized vendor metadata and
warns when the selected harness does not document honoring it.

## Verified references

- The [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
  defines `SKILL.md`, its portable frontmatter, and arbitrary bundled files.
- The [Claude Code skills documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
  documents project skills under `.claude/skills/` and Claude-specific
  frontmatter.
- The [OpenAI skill documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills)
  documents Codex repository skills under `.agents/skills/` and optional
  `agents/openai.yaml` metadata.

These vendor surfaces change independently and must be reverified before adding
or translating another extension.

## Compatibility matrix

| Authored surface | Classification | Claude Code | Codex | tenon behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Portable, required | Native | Native | Validate against the parent directory and preserve. |
| `description` | Portable, required | Native discovery metadata | Native discovery metadata | Validate and preserve. |
| Markdown body | Portable instructions | Native instructions | Native instructions | Preserve; do not interpret prompt behavior. |
| `license` | Portable documentary field | Preserved | Preserved | Preserve without operational claims. |
| `compatibility` | Portable documentary field | Preserved for the model | Preserved for the model | Preserve; tenon does not install or enforce the stated environment. |
| `metadata` string map | Portable documentary extension point | Preserved, normally inert | Preserved, normally inert | Preserve; namespaced keys do not create tenon behavior. |
| `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` | Portable resource conventions | Native resources | Native resources | Copy regular files byte-for-byte. |
| Other nested files and directories | Portable resources | Available to the skill | Available to the skill | Copy regular files byte-for-byte; do not require a fixed resource inventory. The reserved `agents/openai.yaml` exception is below. |
| `allowed-tools` | Experimental standard field; operational in Claude CLI | Temporarily pre-approves listed tools for the invoking turn; it does not restrict other tools | No documented enforcement | Copy unchanged for both. Warn for Codex. Tenon does not enforce it. |

Tenon enforces the standard name rules: 1-64 lowercase ASCII letters, digits,
and single hyphens, with no leading or trailing hyphen, and exact agreement with
the parent directory. `description` is limited to 1-1024 characters;
`compatibility`, when present, is limited to 1-500 characters; `metadata` maps
strings to strings; and `allowed-tools` is a space-separated string.

The portable standard does not define model choice, reasoning effort,
invocation policy, routing, hooks, or a tool-deny policy. Putting such a value
under `metadata` preserves text only; it does not turn the value into behavior.

## Claude Code extensions

Claude Code currently documents these additions to `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

| Field | Effect in Claude Code | Other targets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `when_to_use` | Adds discovery context. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |
| `argument-hint` | Adds command-completion UI text. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |
| `arguments` | Defines named positional substitutions. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |
| `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable` | Controls model or user invocation. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |
| `allowed-tools`, `disallowed-tools` | Grants approval or removes tools for the invoking turn. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex; never reinterpret either as an tenon policy. |
| `model`, `effort` | Selects Claude model or effort for the invoking turn. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex; never describe a recommendation as enforcement. |
| `context`, `agent`, `background` | Routes execution through a Claude subagent. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |
| `hooks` | Runs Claude lifecycle hooks while the skill is active. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |
| `paths` | Limits Claude's automatic activation by file path. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |
| `shell` | Selects the shell for Claude dynamic context commands. | Copy unchanged and warn for Codex. |

Tenon passes recognized Claude extensions through unchanged for either target.
For Codex, it emits one warning per field because Codex does not document their
behavior. Tenon does not translate or enforce them. Dynamic content and argument
placeholders inside the Markdown body remain harness-interpreted content, so
portability claims stop at preserving the file.

## OpenAI host extension

OpenAI documents optional `agents/openai.yaml` inside the skill directory. Tenon
carries it in the Codex project layout:

| Surface | Documented OpenAI meaning | Other targets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interface.*` | ChatGPT desktop presentation metadata and default prompt text. | Copy the file unchanged and warn for Claude. |
| `policy.allow_implicit_invocation` | Enables or disables implicit OpenAI-host invocation; explicit invocation remains available. | Copy the file unchanged and warn for Claude. |
| `dependencies.tools` | Declares supported MCP tool dependencies and connection metadata. | Copy the file unchanged and warn for Claude; copying a declaration is not dependency provisioning. |

Codex documents `name` and `description` as the fields used to decide when to
load `SKILL.md`. It does not document skill-level `allowed-tools`, model, or
effort enforcement. Tenon therefore makes no such claim. `agents/openai.yaml`
remains an OpenAI-host surface, not an tenon configuration file. Tenon emits the
whole file byte-for-byte for either target. Claude apply emits one file-level
warning because Claude does not document the file. Tenon does not parse,
translate, provision dependencies from, or enforce this vendor document.

## Generation and filesystem decisions

1. Generate only project-scoped native skills: `.claude/skills/NAME/` for
   Claude and `.agents/skills/NAME/` for Codex. Never modify personal, user,
   administrator, enterprise, system, or plugin locations.
2. Copy every bounded regular resource file byte-for-byte when the target
   supports it. Preserve its path relative to the skill root, including
   arbitrary directories beyond the conventional `scripts/`, `references/`,
   and `assets/` names. Copy `agents/openai.yaml` unchanged for either target
   and warn for Claude.
3. Preserve executable intent for resource files and include that intent in
   source fingerprints and generated-file ownership checks. A mode-only change
   to an executable resource is a source change.
4. Reject symlinked skill directories, `SKILL.md` files, resources, and nested
   directories. Codex can follow symlinked skill folders, but tenon's portable
   source boundary does not.
5. Require valid UTF-8 relative resource paths so JSON ownership records can
   represent every generated file exactly.
6. Apply [ADR 0013](../adr/0013-bound-authored-projects-with-aggregate-budgets.md)'s
   high skill-count ceiling and shared skill-set file and byte budgets. Keep
   individual skills and resources bounded, and reject entries before reading
   outside those bounds.
7. Parse frontmatter as YAML. Do not extend the former line parser to
   approximate nested `metadata`, lists, booleans, or vendor documents.
8. Diagnose recognized vendor metadata by authored path, field when available,
   selected harness, and passthrough action. Unknown `SKILL.md` frontmatter
   outside the standard `metadata` extension point remains invalid authored
   source rather than speculative vendor behavior.

## Diagnostic rule

Preserve supported and recognized vendor fields unchanged. Warn when the
selected harness does not document honoring them. Fail only for invalid Agent
Skills source, unsafe filesystem content, ownership conflicts, or a target
behavior known to reject the generated setup. Ordinary standard `license`,
`compatibility`, and `metadata` remain preserved but inert.

Warnings are emitted on stderr and identify the authored path, field when
available, selected harness, and that the content was copied unchanged but may
have no effect. Compatibility classifications live in code and tests as well as
this dated matrix; vendor changes require re-verification of the linked
documentation rather than runtime guessing.

This rule prevents two especially misleading claims:

- `allowed-tools` never means that tenon restricts native harness tools. In
  Claude it is a native temporary pre-approval; in Codex it is unsupported.
- A model or effort value is never a cross-harness recommendation or tenon
  enforcement. Claude may honor its documented extension; Codex has no
  equivalent skill field.

## Acceptance evidence

The cutover is complete when credential-free checks prove:

1. A standard-only skill with referenced and arbitrary nested resources
   appears in both native project skill directories with identical bytes.
2. Executable intent survives apply and changes the source fingerprint.
3. Symlinked files or directories and bounded-resource violations fail before
   setup is written.
4. Supported Claude frontmatter survives both applies byte-for-byte apart from
   the generated ownership marker and produces field-level Codex warnings.
5. `agents/openai.yaml` survives both applies byte-for-byte and produces one
   file-level Claude warning.
6. Flat `skills/NAME.md` source is rejected, and all first-party examples use
   `skills/NAME/SKILL.md`.
