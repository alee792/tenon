# Product specification

- Status: the product contract. The `hctl` prototype (alee792/hctl) is the
  frozen, read-only reference implementation.
- Scope: the core product. The conversational channel runtime is a second
  product, specified in the prototype repository.
- Product: Tenon; the binary is `tenon`.
- Initial harnesses: Claude Code and Codex CLI.

## User and job

Two consumers author the same artifact, and both receive balanced
consideration: a person, and an improvement loop revising an agent's
files. A decision may favor one when the tradeoff is evaluated and
recorded — never by default. The human author understands basic files and
directories and common AI concepts such as instructions, skills, and
tools, and should not need to understand registration, manifests, or
harness configuration. The improvement loop needs validation before
anything runs, a reproducible pinned closure, and attribution of every run
to its exact configuration; the agent manifest and machine-consumable
validation serve it directly. There is one capability ladder, not an
author/developer split: the author starts with instructions and composed
skills, and may climb to typed tool functions — written directly or
drafted by their harness. Validation proves a tool's contract, not its
behavior; adopting one remains the author's deliberate, reviewable act,
like any other code.

Operating is a distinct role on the same artifact: credentials, integration
packages, schedules, and staged filesystems carry their own explicit
guardrails. The author defines one filesystem-authored agent project, applies
it to a chosen workspace, and proves it interactively in Claude Code or
Codex; the operator runs the same setup headlessly, which is where
portability is proven.

## Product principles

1. The agent project is legible, versionable, portable source and is not
   coupled to the repository that stores it.
2. Common behavior is portable; harness-specific differences are explicit.
3. Compilation and validation happen before harness files are written or a
   turn dispatcher starts.
4. Generated native files are disposable and visibly tool-owned.
5. Native harness tools remain available and explicitly unmanaged.
6. Policy applies only at managed-tool and durable-state boundaries.
7. Interactive users remain in the native harness interface.
8. Unsupported harness behavior is reported without rewriting valid authored
   source or pretending that tenon enforces it.
9. Conventional files register behavior without a second inventory.
10. Author-facing language stays concrete; runtime terminology remains
    internal.

## What this specification binds

This specification binds authored formats and functional responsibilities,
not interface shape. Authored project formats are exact — the folder is
the portable convention, and its filenames and schemas are the contract.
The tool's own surface is specified by responsibility: validate before
mutation, compile to native integration, pin and verify the runtime
closure, attribute every run to its exact configuration, dispatch turns,
and stage filesystems. The command names, flags, file encodings, and
output framing shown below are the reference rendering of those
responsibilities: a conforming implementation may expose them as a CLI, a
library, or a protocol server, provided every responsibility and
acceptance item holds and every machine-facing output stays stable and
parseable. The reference rendering is deliberately file-and-process
shaped because files, processes, and exit codes are the one interface a
person, a harness, and an improvement loop already share.

## The authored project

Authoring is filesystem-forward and convention-driven. A project is a
directory; the directory name supplies the agent name, normalized to
lowercase hyphenated words. The full component set:

```text
my-agent/
  instructions.md          # optional; see the root rule below
  skills/                  # Agent Skills directories
  plugins/                 # complete publisher-authored Agent Plugin packages
  tools/                   # one typed function per TS/Python file or Go dir
  subagents/               # one instructions.md per immediate subagent
  connections/             # one <name>.md per standalone MCP connection
  schedules/               # nested Markdown cron tasks
  harnesses/               # literal harness-specific native files
  channels/                # second product; specified separately
```

**Instructions.** An agent root is proven one of two ways: by a present
`instructions.md`, or by a supplied agent manifest whose expected source
fingerprint matches the directory. A directory with neither proof is not
an agent project. When present, `instructions.md` starts
with YAML frontmatter carrying one plain `description` (and an optional
Boolean `friction-notes` opting into the friction inbox below), followed
by a non-empty Markdown body; generated always-on instructions contain the
body, not the frontmatter. When absent, the agent generates no always-on
instructions — an empty system prompt is a legitimate candidate for an
improvement loop to try — and the directory name still supplies the agent
name. This is a recorded tradeoff under the balance rule: the file remains
the human journey's front door, while its requiredness no longer
forecloses part of the loop's search space.

**Skills.** Each immediate directory under `skills/` is one skill following
the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):
a `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter `name` matches the directory, plus arbitrary
regular-file resources. Adding or removing a directory updates the compiled
project without registration. Resources copy byte-for-byte with executable
intent preserved. Portable fields validate to the standard's rules;
recognized vendor fields are preserved unchanged with a warning when the
selected harness does not document honoring them — tenon never translates,
strips, or enforces them. The dated per-field behavior matrix is
[skill compatibility](workbench/skill-compatibility.md).

**Plugins.** An [Agent Plugin v1](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) is
one complete publisher-authored package. A consumer vendors the reviewed
directory intact beneath `plugins/<storage-name>/`; review, pinning, and
provenance belong to the author's version control. Tenon records no dependency
lock and performs no network acquisition. Each plugin requires a bounded
`plugin.json` targeting the canonical v1.0.0 schema, validated locally
without fetching. Skills import only from the plugin's fixed `skills/`
location; root skills load first and the first skill name wins, with later
collisions skipped and warned, never renamed. Invalid components are skipped
independently with authored-path diagnostics.

An accepted plugin may carry a bounded `mcp.json` (canonical v1.0.0 MCP
schema; `stdio` and `streamable-http` supported, SSE warned and skipped).
Accepted servers are emitted as native project MCP configuration — the
harness owns startup, approval, transport, authentication, and runtime
behavior; tenon does not proxy, supervise, or audit plugin MCP calls. `managed`
is reserved; exact name collisions are skipped with a warning. Plugin-relative
commands stay inside the real plugin tree; tenon expands exactly
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${PLUGIN_DATA}` once and provides an owner-only
persistent data directory per agent and plugin. Remote URLs are absolute
HTTPS (loopback excepted), without user info or fragments; headers are
literal package-visible values and must not contain secrets.

**Tools.** Visible `tools/*.ts` and `tools/*.py` files and `tools/NAME/tool.go`
directories each declare one tool; filenames supply tool names, with
underscores exposed as hyphens. TypeScript exports a default object with
`description`, strict Zod `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`, and `execute`;
Python exports `description`, Pydantic `Input`/`Output`, and `execute`; Go
exports `Description`, `Input`, `Output`, and `Execute`. Dependencies use the
native lockfiles (`deno.json`/`deno.lock`, `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`,
`go.mod`/`go.sum`); there is no authored manifest, registry, or duplicated
tool inventory.

**Subagents.** Each immediate directory under `subagents/` contains only an
`instructions.md` with the same description-and-body contract plus optional
`effort: low|medium|high`, emitted to each harness's native effort field and
omitted when absent. One level, native inheritance of the parent's generated
instructions, skills, managed tools, and permissions. Child skills, tools,
dependencies, and nested subagents are rejected, not ignored. Subagent and
tool names may not collide.

**Connections.** Each `connections/<name>.md` authors one standalone native
MCP connection; the filename supplies the connection and native server name
(`managed` reserved). Closed YAML frontmatter declares `type: mcp` plus
exactly one target form: an installed stdio target (`package` +
`capability`, resolved offline through the integration store, whose stable
server name must equal the filename) or a credential-free remote target
(`transport: streamable-http` + absolute HTTPS `url`, validated without
contact). No headers, tokens, OAuth, timeouts, or tool filters in v1.
Optional trimmed Markdown after the frontmatter (at most 1,024 characters) is
model-facing usage context rendered once into generated instructions, with
one boundary statement that the native harness owns MCP startup, trust,
approval, authentication, discovery, calls, and effects. Name collisions with
`managed`, another connection, or a plugin server fail before mutation.

Authors need not hand-edit native configuration:

```text
tenon connection add AGENT NAME --package PACKAGE --capability CAPABILITY [--context TEXT]
tenon connection add AGENT NAME --url HTTPS_URL [--context TEXT]
tenon connection status AGENT [NAME]
tenon connection remove AGENT NAME
```

Commands take the exact positional agent root, never search ancestors or
choose a harness, and finish by directing the author to run `tenon apply` for
each intended workspace. There is no update command; the Markdown is ordinary
versioned source.

The GitHub connection is the canonical installed target: the official
`github/github-mcp-server` executable, installed as an integration package,
emitted into native Claude and Codex configuration with server name `github`
and rejection on collision. Authentication is deliberately unmanaged: the
operator injects `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` into the harness launch
environment, the official server reads it directly, and tenon never writes it
into source, generated files, state, staging, logs, or evidence. **The
harness, model-accessible execution tools, and processes inheriting that
environment may read or transmit the PAT; tenon does not claim otherwise, and
a read-only workspace does not constrain GitHub effects.** Fine-grained
scope, short expiration, native-harness trust, and operator judgment are the
security boundary. The operator journey, lifecycle, and troubleshooting live
in [the native GitHub MCP journey](github-native-mcp.md).

**Schedules.** Nested Markdown files under `schedules/`; the relative path
without `.md` is the schedule name. Strict frontmatter carries exactly one
`cron` string (standard five-field, bounded printable ASCII); the non-empty
body is the task prompt. Apply validates and fingerprints schedules but
starts no clock. See headless operation below for execution.

**Harness-specific files.** `harnesses/claude/.claude/` and
`harnesses/codex/.codex/` carry intentionally nonportable native project
files, copied byte-for-byte to only the selected harness at the same
workspace-relative paths. Tenon does not parse, merge, or validate their
semantics. Tenon-owned destinations remain reserved (Claude `.claude/skills/`
and `.claude/agents/`; Codex `.codex/config.toml` and `.codex/agents/`),
including case-folded aliases. Authors must not place credentials in these
files; tenon does not claim reliable secret detection.

**Bounds.** Authored source is bounded by implementation-owned safety
ceilings rather than ordinary-use quotas; exceeding a ceiling fails before
workspace mutation:

| Surface | Count ceiling | File and aggregate ceilings |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Root instructions | One optional file (the root needs instructions or a manifest) | 128 KiB |
| Root and imported skills | 256 aggregate | 1,024 files per skill; 8,192 files and 64 MiB across the set; `SKILL.md` 128 KiB; other resources 16 MiB each |
| Authored tools | 128 | 1,024 source and dependency files; 1 MiB each and 64 MiB aggregate |
| Immediate subagents | 128 | 128 KiB each and 16 MiB aggregate |
| Schedules | 256 | 128 KiB per source, including a 32 KiB prompt; 16 MiB aggregate |
| Vendored plugins | 128 directory entries | `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` 128 KiB each; 1,024 entries per plugin `skills/` location |
| Accepted plugin MCP servers | 128 aggregate | Generated native MCP configuration at most 8 MiB |
| Selected harness-specific files | 1,024 | 1 MiB each and 8 MiB aggregate |
| Standalone MCP connections | 128 | 8 KiB per source; context at most 1,024 characters |
| Agent manifest | One optional file, supplied at application | 32 KiB |

Everywhere: authored entries are bounded regular files and real directories
with valid UTF-8 relative paths; symlinks are never followed and are rejected
even where a native harness supports them, so portable source cannot escape
the agent project.

## Apply and handoff

```sh
tenon apply AGENT --workspace WORKSPACE --harness <claude|codex>
```

Apply validates the authored project, the target harness, tool definitions,
and locked dependencies, then materializes owned native files in the selected
workspace so the user starts the harness normally. `--workspace` defaults to
the agent directory; the agent source and the workspace are independent.
Claude receives `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/skills/`, and
`.claude/agents/`; Codex receives `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/config.toml`,
`.agents/skills/`, and `.codex/agents/`. Generated files are visibly
tool-owned and disposable. Apply refuses to overwrite hand-authored native
files or any tenon-owned file modified since the previous apply, and
reapplying identical source is deterministic. An explicit `--discard-local`
flag lets apply overwrite a tenon-owned file modified since the previous
apply instead of refusing it; it never widens the hand-authored-file
refusal; a file apply never recorded as its own is refused with or without
the flag. All authored inputs join one source fingerprint recorded with the
apply, so stale or edited generated setup fails closed. Codex project trust
remains the user's native decision; apply never edits global harness
configuration or trusts a project on the user's behalf.

`tenon validate AGENT --harness <claude|codex>` runs the same validation as
apply without writing anything: it loads and bounds the project, checks
tool contracts and, when a manifest is present, the pinned closure, and
exits nonzero on failure. Diagnostics are bounded prose by default, with a
machine-readable mode (one JSON diagnostic per line in the reference
rendering) carrying a stable identifier, the authored path, and the exact
rule violated; apply's own failures carry the same identifiers. Prose
stays primary for people; the stable identifiers exist because a drafting
harness or an improvement loop correcting its own files cannot reliably
parse prose. The binding requirements are parity with apply, stability of
the identifiers, and machine readability — not the flag or the framing.

On success, in the same machine-readable mode, both commands emit one
further JSON object after any diagnostic lines: a result summary carrying
the agent name and source fingerprint (apply's also carries the harness,
workspace, and the written/removed/managed-tool lists). This object is
shaped differently from a diagnostic line — it has no `id`, `path`, or
`rule` field — so a consumer parsing the diagnostic stream must expect it
as the stream's final, distinct line rather than mistake it for a
malformed diagnostic. `tenon fingerprint show AGENT` runs the identical
tool-preparation gate as validate and apply — a project whose tools cannot
be built never reports a fingerprint — and in its own machine-readable
mode emits the same per-file entries that feed the rollup (path, content
hash, executable bit) followed by one closing object carrying the
rolled-up fingerprint, in the same "stream of objects, closing summary
line" shape.

`tenon drift AGENT --workspace WORKSPACE --harness <claude|codex>` reports
whether a workspace still carries exactly what a fresh apply would produce,
writing nothing at all: it regenerates every tenon-owned file in memory on
apply's own generation path, then compares each against both the workspace
and the apply record — the same ownership rule apply's conflict check
enforces, not merely a byte comparison against the fresh regeneration — and
reports it unchanged, modified on disk (with a unified diff), missing, or
stale (recorded by a previous apply but no longer generated). Drift
deliberately never adopts a workspace edit back into source: generation is
lossy in reverse, so tenon never guesses author intent from a diff. Drift
only shows the diff; the author edits source and reapplies, optionally with
`--discard-local` to explicitly discard the workspace edit. Its
machine-readable mode carries the same stable per-finding identifiers and
diagnostics discipline as validate and apply.

## Agent manifest

An optional bounded agent manifest (`manifest.json` in the reference
rendering) pins the runtime closure that the directory alone cannot
express. It belongs to application, not to the definition: the same source
directory applies under different manifests — one commit crossed with many
pin sets — without the definition changing. The manifest is therefore
supplied to validate, apply, and run rather than stored inside the agent
source, and it lives wherever its operator or loop versions it. Its
responsibility, not its encoding or location, is the contract: it
identifies and pins; it never lists. The directory remains the sole
registry of the agent's components, and a supplied manifest whose expected
fingerprint matches the directory also proves the agent root, so a
generated candidate need not carry instructions it does not want.

Its closed schema records a schema version, the agent name, the expected
source fingerprint, the tenon version, and — per selected harness — the
harness executable version, a model identifier, integration package
identities (package id plus manifest SHA-256), and authored-tool runtime
versions (Deno, uv, Go) where the project uses them.

`tenon manifest write AGENT --harness ...` records the currently resolved
closure to a caller-chosen path; the result is an ordinary versioned file
and may be edited directly. When a manifest is supplied, validate, apply,
and every tenon-owned process open verify the resolved closure against it
and fail closed naming the exact drifted pin; when none is supplied,
behavior is unchanged. The model pin is
emitted through the selected harness's documented configuration and
recorded in provenance; the harness owns model selection, and tenon does not
claim to verify which model actually served a turn.

Every apply record and dispatch lifecycle event carries the source
fingerprint and, when present, the manifest identity, so observation made
outside tenon — transcripts, evaluations, selection among revisions — can be
joined to the exact configuration that produced it. Tenon retains none of
that observation: no transcripts, no evaluations, no scores. An improvement
loop revising the agent's files is an author like any other: its revision
is validated for form before anything runs, and its merit is judged outside
tenon. The friction inbox remains a supplementary human-facing channel, not
the loop's signal path.

The applied agent is not told how it was set up. Tenon never renders the
manifest, its pins, model identity, or provenance into generated
instructions or any other model-facing content: setup metadata exists for
the operator and the loop, not for the running agent. Whether a harness's
native tools can read files an operator leaves on disk remains native
behavior, and tenon does not claim to blind a harness to its environment.

A pin is an axis of variation, not an editable surface: a loop may try a
different model or harness version by changing a pin, while the components
it can edit remain the authored files. Lineage and population management
belong to version control: a candidate is a source revision crossed with a
supplied manifest, each versioned wherever its owner keeps it, and tenon
neither records lineage nor selects among candidates. How variants are
isolated — worktrees, containers, or sandboxes — is the operator's
infrastructure choice; tenon requires only that each variant is a directory
that applies deterministically.

## Managed tool boundary

One stdio MCP server exposes the bounded built-in `echo` tool, the optional
`record-friction` built-in, and the authored tools to both harnesses. Inputs
and outputs are schema-validated; audit output carries a safe request
identifier, tool name, and lifecycle outcome — never arguments or output. One
long-lived host per authored language serves calls; authors never write
protocol code. The boundary is additive: it does not disable, authorize,
observe, or retry harness-native tools.

Codex treats the generated managed server as required and delegates its tool
approval to tenon, so an authorized managed call does not draw a second
harness prompt; every other generated MCP entry — plugin, connection, or
installed — keeps native per-call prompt approval. This exemption applies
only to the managed server and does not affect native or unrelated MCP
tools.

`record-friction` is advertised only when root instructions opt in with
`friction-notes: true`. It accepts one bounded UTF-8 note and stores it in a
private, owner-only, per-agent local inbox outside both agent source and
workspace, write-only to models, never automatically read, transmitted, or
applied. It is not telemetry, memory, or evidence. At most 256 records are
retained per agent, and the store never overwrites or silently evicts.

Secret-bearing managed operations do not exist yet. Before one ships, the
secretless operation broker boundary applies
([ADR 0006](adr/0006-use-a-local-secretless-operation-broker.md)): opaque
references resolve only at authorized managed invocations, values never reach
tool hosts, harnesses, models, generated files, or audit, and no backend or
broker code is scaffolded until a concrete operation is selected.

## Integration packages

Machine-installed third-party integrations use a metadata-first package
contract distinct from vendored `plugins/`. A bounded schema-version-1
manifest carries identity, provenance, a tenon compatibility range, exact
platform artifacts (size and SHA-256 pinned), the expected executable
identity, and closed versioned capability declarations. Tenon validates
metadata without opening artifacts, fetching URLs, or executing package code.

`tenon integration install SOURCE --trust operator` is the only trust and
installation journey: a local directory or archive containing
`integration.json`, or artifacts fetched only from exact pinned HTTPS URLs
without redirects. There is no registry, package script, dependency
resolver, or signature claim. Installed state lives in one owner-only,
content-addressed, offline-verified store shared across agents and
workspaces; `inspect`, `verify`, `list`, `enable`, `disable`, `update`, and
`remove` operate on that store, and verification is re-run before every use.
Portable agent source can never choose an install source, install or enable a
package, grant trust, or carry a credential; apply gains no network path.

Recognized capabilities are closed schemas. The core implements `native-mcp`
v1: a stable native server name, executable, bounded literal launch data,
required ambient environment names without values, and supported harness
targets — consumed by installed connections. `channel-adapter` v1 belongs to
the channel product, specified in the prototype repository: the core does
not implement its recognition and it is not acceptance-gating; it is
reintroduced only if the channel product is ported onto this core. The native harness owns
process lifecycle, credentials, approvals, calls, and effects for everything
a package launches. Required ambient names are diagnostic metadata, not a
credential channel; resolved values never enter generated files, package
state, staging, or evidence.

## Headless operation

```sh
printf '%s\n' '{"input_id":"x-1","text":"..."}' \
  | tenon run AGENT --workspace WS --harness <claude|codex> --input jsonl
```

The turn dispatcher accepts bounded JSONL input, each line carrying a
caller-owned `input_id` and `text`. Input is durably accepted and queued
while a turn is active, processed one FIFO turn per conversation, and mapped
to a resumable native session; ordered JSONL events are emitted. A repeated
input ID deduplicates within its conversation. After restart, active work
without a proven terminal result is uncertain and never silently retried.
Dispatch state is one owner-only file per workspace.

Schedules execute two ways, both requiring current generated setup:

```sh
tenon schedule trigger AGENT NAME --workspace WS --harness codex \
  --input-id OCCURRENCE_ID --turn-timeout 90s --timeout 2m
tenon schedule run AGENT --workspace WS --harness codex
```

`trigger` dispatches one occurrence under a caller-owned stable ID: each
accepted occurrence opens a fresh native task session, duplicates return the
retained outcome without opening a harness, and the bounded turn deadline
aborts a stalled process while durably recording the occurrence as uncertain
with its reason. `run` is an explicit foreground UTC clock: standard cron
evaluated in UTC, first occurrence strictly after startup, no downtime or
clock-jump backfill, no overlap for one schedule, a local lock excluding a
second clock for the same workspace/agent/harness, and graceful drain on
signals. Lifecycle output is bounded and never contains model text. No
daemon, missed-run replay, or hosted delivery runtime.

## Staged agent filesystems

`tenon stage AGENT --harness <claude|codex> --output DIR` prepares one
complete runnable filesystem tree at canonical paths for an existing OCI
builder:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/alee792/tenon/codex:${TENON_VERSION} AS build   # not yet published; see docs/harness-images.md
COPY . /agent
RUN tenon stage /agent --harness codex --output /out/agent

FROM docker.io/library/ubuntu:24.04
COPY --from=build /out/agent/opt/ /opt/
COPY --from=build --chown=65532:65532 /out/agent/workspace/ /workspace/
COPY --from=build --chown=65532:65532 /out/agent/home/tenon/ /home/tenon/
USER 65532:65532
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/tenon/bin/agent-entrypoint"]
```

`ghcr.io/alee792/tenon/codex` is not yet published; build the harness image
locally from [`images/codex/Dockerfile`](../images/codex/Dockerfile) (or
[`images/claude/Dockerfile`](../images/claude/Dockerfile)) instead. The
final base is a pinned Ubuntu LTS platform manifest, `linux/amd64`, glibc —
never Alpine or another musl base without a separately built musl payload.
See [harness images](harness-images.md) for the full compatible-base
contract, both journeys, and what gates publication.

The staged tree carries tenon, the selected harness, immutable agent source,
the generated integration and apply record, an entrypoint, an artifact
manifest, and only the execution closure the agent's tools actually need —
no build toolchains, caches, credentials, login state, trust decisions, or
conversation state. Staging is deterministic for identical pinned inputs,
verifies that preparation did not mutate authored source, and publishes with
one rename only after the manifest is complete. The entrypoint verifies
runtime identity, generated integration, and source fingerprint before a
turn. Tenon does not construct OCI layers, contact registries, publish, sign,
deploy, or operate images, and publishing a harness image requires current
permission to redistribute that harness.

## Installation and distribution

The supported platforms are `darwin-arm64`, `linux-amd64`, and
`linux-arm64`. The exact `vX.Y.Z` tag names, for each platform,
`tenon_X.Y.Z_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` (one executable at the archive root), plus
one `tenon_X.Y.Z_SHA256SUMS` manifest covering every archive of that
release; the user verifies, extracts to a stable `PATH` location, and runs
`tenon apply`. Generated MCP configuration records the resolved absolute
executable path, so moving the binary requires reapplying. `go install` is
not a supported end-user journey, and there is no `tenon package` command:
agent source and lockfiles are inputs to `apply`, while generated hosts and
dependency environments remain disposable workspace-local caches.

## Deferred bets

Recorded once here; none is scaffolded until its trigger arrives:

- **Proposals** — inert, workspace-local, human-reviewed improvement
  records; a future capture tool must remain additive, never apply a diff,
  and never claim reliable secret detection. The prototype's ADR 0008
  records the full convention. Reviewed when an author or improvement loop
  needs a mutation record richer than a branch; falsified — and deleted —
  if version-control review proves sufficient.
- **Secretless operation broker** — the boundary for the first secret-bearing
  managed operation ([ADR 0006](adr/0006-use-a-local-secretless-operation-broker.md)).
  Reviewed when that operation is selected; falsified if native harnesses
  ship an equivalent credential boundary first.
- **Post-run summaries** — must reference native logs rather than duplicate
  transcripts. Reviewed when a harness exposes stable runtime IDs;
  falsified if native logs remain sufficient on their own.

## Failure and safety behavior

- Missing, stale, ambiguous, or edited generated harness integrations fail
  closed.
- Input, output, queue, process lifetime, state size, and protocol lines are
  bounded.
- Durable state is owner-readable only and written atomically.
- Process failure is distinct from a completed or failed model turn.
- An uncertain external effect is never described as exactly-once or retried
  without a target idempotency contract.
- Tenon-owned diagnostics never expose credentials, private prompts, or raw
  process output; native harness and external-server diagnostics remain
  outside that claim.
- Tenon never claims to enforce instructions, inspect native effects, sandbox
  authored code, or make model behavior safe from outside the harness.

## Acceptance

Every stated behavior in this specification binds; the list below is the
proof skeleton, not the whole contract. The core is complete when
credential-free tests (fake harness processes; no live model calls) prove:

1. One authored project compiles deterministically for both harnesses, and
   apply produces native, discoverable files while refusing conflicts and
   modified-file overwrites; a directory proven by neither instructions
   nor a supplied matching manifest is refused as not an agent project,
   and an instructions-free project generates an empty always-on surface
   rather than failing.
2. Both generated integrations expose the same managed MCP tool surface, and
   a mixed TypeScript/Python/Go project is prepared once per apply with one
   host process per language.
3. Agent source applies outside its own directory: generated files and
   execution use the workspace while discovery stays rooted in source.
4. Subagents generate natively with inheritance and exact effort mapping,
   and child skills, tools, dependencies, and nested subagents are rejected
   rather than ignored; skills and their resources round-trip byte-for-byte
   with executable intent, vendor metadata preserved and warned;
   harness-specific files round-trip only to their selected harness with
   full ownership protection.
5. Plugin skills and plugin MCP declarations import with deterministic
   collision handling and isolated component failure.
6. Connections generate exact native configuration for installed and remote
   targets without contacting anything; a name collision with `managed`,
   another connection, or a plugin server fails before mutation; and a
   conspicuous fake ambient value never appears in generated files, state,
   staging, or evidence.
7. Headless dispatch durably queues FIFO input, deduplicates input IDs,
   resumes sessions, and marks unproven restart work uncertain.
8. Schedules validate and fingerprint identically for both harnesses;
   triggers deduplicate stable occurrence IDs, open fresh sessions, honor
   turn deadlines with retained uncertainty, and the UTC clock admits only
   current non-overlapping occurrences and drains on shutdown.
9. Staging produces a deterministic, credential-free, minimal runnable tree
   whose entrypoint verifies identity and fingerprint before a turn;
   preparation never mutates authored source, and publication is one rename
   only after the manifest is complete.
10. Managed audit output remains content-free.
11. A supplied agent manifest is verified before apply and before every
    tenon-owned process open: a drifted harness version, package identity,
    or source fingerprint fails closed naming the exact pin; writing the
    manifest for an unchanged closure is byte-identical; an unsupplied
    manifest changes nothing; and no pin, fingerprint, or provenance value
    appears in model-facing generated content.
12. Validate reports the same failures as apply without mutating anything,
    and its structured diagnostics carry stable identifiers and authored
    paths that match apply's own failures.

## Known limitations

Recorded here rather than hidden, per the failure and safety principle
above:

- **Staging.** Per [ADR 0021](adr/0021-execute-authored-tools-from-a-self-contained-closure.md),
  the native harness runtime is not yet bundled into the staged tree
  (expected on the base image), and the authored-tool execution closure is
  staged whole rather than minimized, both recorded in the staging artifact
  manifest. Go and Python authored tools stage and serve from the staged
  tree today: the closure is a self-contained Go host binary, or a pinned
  standalone CPython interpreter with the project's locked dependencies laid
  flat beside it (no venv), reachable from the staged apply record's
  `closure_root`. TypeScript remains refused with a named diagnostic
  (`stage.tools.runtime-unsupported`) pending its own bounded rendering
  spike (issue #16). The container gate is manual: CI does not build or run
  a staged image, so run
  [`scripts/check-staged-images.sh`](../scripts/check-staged-images.sh)
  (see [`docs/staged-acceptance.md`](staged-acceptance.md)) before a
  release.
- **Python tool preparation requires the network, every run.** `tenon
  validate` and `tenon apply` for a Python-tool agent fetch the pinned
  standalone CPython interpreter (`uv python install`, roughly 90MB) even
  when it was already fetched by a previous run: `uv` does not cache the
  downloaded interpreter tarball itself (only its already-installed,
  already-normalized closure is cached, per source fingerprint), so a
  network-restricted machine needs the pinned interpreter artifact
  reachable through whatever channel supplies tenon's other pinned inputs,
  on every prepare, not only the first. A `requires-python` constraint in
  `pyproject.toml` installs the *floor* of the range (`>=3.11,<3.13`
  installs 3.11, not 3.12); a `.python-version` file, when present, names
  the version exactly and takes precedence over `requires-python`.
- **Real harness drivers.** The Claude and Codex drivers are validated by
  pure-function unit tests plus manual `//go:build harness` integration
  tests against live binaries; CI does not run the latter, so CI green means
  "dispatcher and drivers correct as specified," not "verified against
  today's Claude/Codex." The Codex driver's successful-turn path has not
  been validated live — only its credential-safe 401 classification has.
- **Manifest verification scope.** A supplied agent manifest is verified at
  `tenon run`'s session start, not re-verified per turn within that
  session; the recurring `schedule run` path does re-verify each
  occurrence.
- **Not in scope (no ADR).** Evaluations, scoring, transcript retention,
  selection among revisions, lineage tracking, a marketplace, and network
  acquisition of components; the conversational channel product stays in
  the prototype.

## Explicit non-goals

- A model loop, context manager, or cross-harness chat UI
- A marketplace, automatic updater, network acquisition, or dependency lock
  for vendored components
- Claude Agent SDK or hosted OpenAI agent runtimes
- Background or distributed schedule clocks, workflows, independently
  configured nested subagents, or deployment orchestration
- Building OCI manifests or layers, publishing or signing images, or hosted
  image operation
- Governance claims over native harness tools
- Evaluations, scoring, transcript retention, or selection among agent
  revisions — tenon is an improvement loop's substrate, never the loop
- Hosted secret managers and model-visible secret-bearing managed operations
- GitHub OAuth or GitHub App enrollment, a managed MCP proxy, credential
  brokering, or per-call tenon authorization
- Automatic or unreviewed promotion of agent-authored improvements
