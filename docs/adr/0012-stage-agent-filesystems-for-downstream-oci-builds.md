# ADR 0012: Stage agent filesystems for downstream OCI builds

- Status: accepted
- Re-records: prototype ADR 0027 (alee792/hctl)

## Decision

Add an OCI-neutral staging boundary for deployable agents. Tenon prepares a
complete runnable filesystem tree that an existing build system can copy onto
a documented compatible base image. Tenon will not construct OCI manifests or
layers, contact a registry, publish, sign, deploy, or operate the resulting
image.

Publish one tenon image for Codex and one for Claude. Each contains the
matching tenon release, one pinned native harness, and all supported
authored-tool build and execution inputs. A user may add and apply an agent in
that image and ship the resulting larger image directly. A staging command
additionally lets the same image act as a disposable build stage by carrying
only the selected agent's required execution closure into a clean compatible
image.

The direct journey is valid:

```dockerfile
FROM <tenon harness image for codex>
COPY . /agent
RUN /opt/tenon/bin/tenon apply /agent --workspace /workspace --harness codex
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/tenon/bin/tenon", "run", "/agent", "--workspace", "/workspace", "--harness", "codex"]
```

The documented two-stage optimization is:

```dockerfile
FROM <tenon harness image for codex> AS build
COPY . /agent
RUN tenon stage /agent --harness codex --output /out/agent

FROM DOCUMENTED_COMPATIBLE_BASE
COPY --from=build /out/agent/opt/ /opt/
COPY --from=build --chown=65532:65532 /out/agent/workspace/ /workspace/
COPY --from=build --chown=65532:65532 /out/agent/home/tenon/ /home/tenon/
USER 65532:65532
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/tenon/bin/agent-entrypoint"]
```

The source image creates `/out` as a writable directory owned by UID/GID
65532. Staging runs as that identity and atomically creates a new child such
as `/out/agent`; the output directory itself must not already exist.

The Claude journeys change only the source image and harness argument. The
two-stage form is recommended when image size, build-tool exposure, or offline
startup matters; it is not required for correctness. `tenon stage` is the
command name, not an authored manifest or a tenon-owned image builder.
Publishing either harness image remains separate, explicitly authorized work
gated on its acceptance contract and the harness vendor's redistribution
terms.

### Staged layout

One staged tree contains these fixed runtime locations:

```text
/opt/tenon/artifact.json
/opt/tenon/bin/tenon
/opt/tenon/bin/agent-entrypoint
/opt/tenon/harness/...
/opt/tenon/runtimes/...
/opt/tenon/agents/AGENT_NAME/...
/workspace/...
/home/tenon/...
```

`AGENT_NAME` is the normalized authored project name. Keeping it in the staged
source path preserves the directory-derived identity rather than renaming
every staged project `agent`. Generated MCP configuration and runtime receipts
refer only to these final paths, never build-stage source or output paths. The
entrypoint runs the staged tenon, agent source, workspace, and harness
selection without a shell wrapper supplied by the downstream build.

The staged source and workspace remain separate as selected by
[ADR 0003](0003-separate-agent-source-from-workspace.md). Portable source is
immutable image content. The workspace contains generated harness integration,
the apply record, and prepared tool execution artifacts, and is the native
harness working directory. A deployment must preserve those staged files and
make the runtime-owned portions of the workspace writable; mounting an empty
volume over the whole workspace would hide the required integration and is not
a supported composition.

`artifact.json` is generated bookkeeping, not author configuration. It records
its schema version, tenon generator version, selected harness and version,
agent name and identity, source fingerprint, target OS and architecture, libc
or equivalent ABI, compatible base identifier, required runtime set, final
paths, and the hashes, modes, and intended runtime ownership of every other
staged file plus the modes and intended ownership of staged directories.
Identical agent source and pinned image inputs must produce identical staged
file contents and metadata. Downstream image metadata, timestamps,
compression, and image digest remain the downstream builder's responsibility.

### Runtime selection

Staging carries the union of execution requirements discovered from authored
tools:

- A tool-free agent carries no Deno, Python, uv, or Go runtime.
- A TypeScript agent carries the pinned Deno executable, generated host, and
  locked dependency cache needed for cached-only execution.
- A Python agent carries the pinned Python and uv execution closure, generated
  host, and locked prepared environment.
- A Go agent carries the compiled host and any required runtime shared-library
  closure, but not the Go compiler, module cache, or generated build module.
- A mixed-language agent carries only the union of those requirements.

Build-only compilers, unused language runtimes, download caches, package
manager caches, and temporary inspection output are discarded. Staging targets
the source image's own OS and architecture; cross-compilation is not promised.
Each published harness image declares one exact compatible final-base
contract. A glibc-built payload cannot be copied onto Alpine merely because
both images use Linux; a separate harness image built for a musl ABI would be
required.

The compatible-base contract also names required shared libraries, certificate
and shell facilities, the non-root runtime UID and GID, and a writable harness
home. The staged entrypoint requires UID/GID 65532 and uses `/home/tenon`; the
workspace and that home must be copied with matching ownership. The downstream
base may provide additional native utilities, but it must not silently run the
staged entrypoint as root or omit facilities the pinned harness requires.

### Runtime and credential boundary

The staged tree includes generated harness files, the apply record, prepared
tool hosts and execution dependencies, and a content-free artifact manifest.
It excludes all runtime-created or operator-owned state:

- model-provider credentials and native harness login state;
- user-level harness configuration and trust decisions;
- tenon user configuration;
- dispatch conversations, native harness sessions, logs, and audit output; and
- registry credentials, signing material, and deployment configuration.

Those values are injected, mounted, or established through the selected
harness's documented runtime mechanisms. Staging must not contact a model,
validate live credentials, or silently create a native user trust decision.
Durable runtime state remains outside the immutable staged artifact and must
be placed on storage appropriate to the deployment. The staging implementation
must state which workspace and harness-home paths require that storage before
it can claim restart-safe operation.

Authored source is copied into the artifact and remains prohibited from
containing credentials. Tenon does not claim that staging can reliably detect
a secret hidden in an otherwise allowed authored string or binary resource.
"Excludes" means staging never reads credentials from environment variables,
native stores, user homes, or deployment inputs and never introduces them into
the artifact.

The selected native harness still owns model calls, native tools, approvals,
and sandbox behavior. Packaging the processes together does not expand tenon's
policy boundary or make native harness effects managed.

This decision does not itself grant permission to redistribute a native
harness. Publishing either image requires a current review of that harness's
license and distribution terms. If redistribution is not permitted, that image
remains unpublished until the vendor authorizes it or supplies an equivalent
distributable artifact; tenon must not replace the pinned harness with an
unverified runtime download merely to preserve the example journey.

## Context

[ADR 0005](0005-first-install-release-archive.md) intentionally chose a single
`darwin-arm64` release archive for the first local installation and rejected
speculative copying of workspace caches. That remains the supported local
installation journey. A concrete distribution need exists: authors want normal
OCI build systems to consume a tenon-prepared agent without carrying every
compiler and unused runtime into the final image.

Raw workspace cache directories are not a sufficient artifact. Apply records
and executable receipts bind source, workspace, tenon, Deno, and uv to
absolute paths, Python environments may encode their installation location,
and compiled Go hosts are platform-specific. Staging therefore re-prepares and
verifies the agent inside the target image, installs the result at canonical
final paths, and publishes a manifest for the complete closure. It does not
declare an arbitrary local cache relocatable.

The alternatives were to require every deployment to ship the large
all-runtimes image, publish a matrix of harness and language-combination
images, or make tenon itself an OCI builder. The first remains a supported
convenience but cannot produce a smaller closure, the second grows
combinatorially, and the third duplicates mature build, registry, and
supply-chain systems. Optional selective staging keeps tenon responsible for
the compilation facts it already knows while leaving image construction to
existing tools.

## Consequence

ADR 0003's source/workspace separation defines the two canonical staged
locations. ADR 0005 remains authoritative for first local installation, but
its deferral of relocatable packaging and agent images is superseded for this
bounded staging contract. There is still no `tenon package` command and no
permission to copy arbitrary local runtime caches between machines.

The staging implementation must separate physical build paths from embedded
runtime paths, produce and verify the artifact manifest, select only
discovered runtime closures, fail before publishing partial output, and prove
a credential-free launch from the documented compatible clean base. Harness
image publication is a separate, explicitly authorized operation.

Downstream users own their final base contents, extra native tools, image
metadata, SBOM and provenance generation, signing, registry publication,
runtime credentials, writable and durable mounts, network policy, and
deployment platform. Tenon cannot claim reproducibility or safety for changes
made after the staged tree leaves its boundary.
