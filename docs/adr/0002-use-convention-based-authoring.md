# ADR 0002: Use convention-based authoring

- Status: accepted
- Re-records: prototype ADR 0003 (alee792/hctl)
- Extended by: [ADR 0008](0008-run-schedules-as-fresh-dispatch-tasks.md),
  [ADR 0009](0009-import-vendored-agent-plugin-skills.md),
  and [ADR 0015](0015-use-the-official-github-server-as-native-unmanaged-mcp.md)

## Decision

Make the authored directory layout the project API. Derive the agent name from
the directory, load descriptive `instructions.md`, and discover optional
authored paths such as Agent Skills directories at `skills/NAME/SKILL.md`,
`tools/`, and immediate `subagents/` without a registry or required
configuration file. Copy supported regular skill resources into each harness's
project skill location. Keep harness-specific skill metadata beside `SKILL.md`
only when the target has an honest native representation. When applying
recognized vendor metadata to a different harness, copy it unchanged and warn
that it may have no effect rather than translating or stripping it.

## Context

Authors may be nontechnical but can work with directories and common AI
concepts such as instructions, skills, and tools. Repeating the filesystem
inventory in configuration adds an internal concept and creates drift. Eve's
filesystem-forward conventions provide the clearer precedent.

## Consequence

New authored concepts should use an obvious conventional directory before
adding configuration. Configuration is reserved for settings the layout cannot
express. Harness-specific filenames remain generated setup details.
