## Plain-English summary

Third-party integrations that are not portable authored source are exact,
operator-installed packages containing external executables. Tenon validates a
small manifest without executing the package, then gives each recognized
capability to its own narrow consumer. The first capability is a native stdio
MCP server. Its process belongs to Claude Code or Codex after tenon writes
native configuration; it does not become a tenon-managed tool.

## Decision

Define one metadata-first package envelope with schema version 1. A package
has an exact semantic version, stable id, human-readable name and description,
license, source and revision provenance, and a half-open tenon compatibility
range (`minimum <= version < before`). The SHA-256 of the exact bounded
manifest bytes is its immutable manifest identity. Reformatting or changing
any field therefore creates a different identity even when the package id and
version are unchanged.

The manifest declares one or more platform artifacts. Each artifact has a
stable id, an exact supported OS and architecture, a bounded `binary`,
`tar.gz`, or `zip` format, size and lowercase SHA-256, and the expected
package-relative executable path, size, and SHA-256 after preparation. Its
source is a closed union:

- `package` names one normalized package-relative payload; or
- `https` names one HTTPS URL without embedded credentials, query, or
  fragment.

Both forms remain pinned by size and checksum. Metadata validation reads no
artifact. It does not resolve a symlink, fetch a URL, inspect an archive, load
a library, or start a process. Installation and content verification remain a
separate phase from metadata validation and are defined below.

Decoded package values retain their validated manifest privately and return
defensive metadata copies. Capability selection therefore always derives from
the exact bytes named by the retained manifest SHA-256; mutating a caller's
copy cannot create selection evidence with a stale identity.

Capabilities are closed, tagged schemas with a stable capability id, type, and
integer version. Schema 1 recognizes `native-mcp` version 1. An unknown type
or version rejects the manifest with a typed unsupported-capability error; it
never invokes package code to discover behavior. Later capability schemas
share the envelope without adding fields to another capability or introducing
one generic runtime interface.

Package installation state is operator-owned and separate from the manifest.
Its closed schema version 1 records the package id and version, exact manifest
SHA-256, explicit `operator` trust, package-level enabled flag, verified
artifact and executable SHA-256 identities, and the exact id/type/version of
every declared capability. Validation binds all fields back to the immutable
manifest. It contains no executable path, credential material, or runtime
value. The installer persists that state and implements its commands; it does
not invent the state contract. Portable source may request a known package
capability, but it cannot choose a source or installed version, install or
enable a package, grant machine trust, or carry a credential.

### Native MCP capability version 1

A `native-mcp` declaration contains:

- one stable native server name with collision policy fixed to `reject`;
- the exact artifact ids forming its selective runtime and staging closure;
- one package-relative executable that must match every referenced artifact's
  executable identity;
- bounded literal arguments, package-relative working directory, and
  non-secret environment defaults;
- required ambient environment-variable names with safe descriptions, never
  values or references; and
- one or both native harness targets, each with `optional` or `required`
  startup and `native-project` trust ownership.

Literal arguments and environment defaults cannot contain environment
placeholders. A required ambient name cannot also have a default. The
manifest's capability/artifact references plus exact manifest, artifact, and
executable hashes provide the content-free evidence needed by apply and
staging to select one installed executable. The contract does not resolve or
retain an ambient value.

`native-project` means the selected native harness owns its project trust and
approval journey. Installing an exact package is the operator's authorization
for the selected external executable to run with its documented process
authority, but a package manifest cannot silently modify user, administrator,
or enterprise trust. Capability-specific delivery decisions define the exact
native configuration and unattended journey.

Once configured, Claude Code or Codex owns native MCP process startup,
lifecycle, authentication, approvals, discovery, calls, effects, cancellation,
results, and errors. Tenon does not proxy, supervise, authorize, filter,
confirm, retry, observe, or audit that traffic. Required ambient names are
diagnostic metadata, not a credential channel; resolved values must not enter
package state, generated files, staged filesystems, or retained evidence.

The resolved ambient value is nevertheless available to the native
harness-launched server and may also be visible to the harness,
model-accessible shell or execution tools, and other inherited native
processes. `native-mcp` does not claim to hide it. Required-environment
descriptions use a closed 1-512 character prose alphabet: ASCII letters,
spaces, commas, periods, semicolons, parentheses, apostrophes, and hyphens,
beginning with a letter. Variable markers, underscores, URI/reference
punctuation, equals signs, and token-like machine syntax are therefore
invalid. No text grammar can reliably recognize an arbitrary secret disguised
as prose; package authors remain prohibited from placing values or references
there.

### Dependency direction

Core package lookup and capability consumers depend on these validated data
contracts. A consumer asks for one versioned capability and receives exact
immutable selection evidence. Vendor packages depend inward on the manifest
schema or their later capability protocol and run as separate executables.
They cannot contribute in-process interfaces, import themselves into tenon,
register an in-process lifecycle, or make core switch on a vendor name.

The common envelope owns only identity, provenance, compatibility, artifacts,
capability tags, enablement, and selective closure. MCP configuration,
credentials, providers, and other runtime behavior remain separate capability
domains.

### Installation, cache, and offline selection

The installer accepts one explicit operator-trusted local package directory,
zip archive, or tar.gz archive. Its root contains the exact
`integration.json`. Package artifacts are either safe relative payloads under
that source or the exact manifest-pinned HTTPS URLs already defined above.
Redirects are not followed. A different manifest under an installed package id
requires an explicit `update` naming that id and another `operator` trust
decision; ordinary install never causes version or manifest drift.

One owner-only OS-user store is shared across agents and workspaces. It keeps
exact manifests and raw platform artifacts by SHA-256 and prepares binary,
zip, and tar.gz artifacts into immutable content-addressed regular-file trees.
Every prepared tree carries a bounded receipt of its paths, sizes, hashes, and
normalized modes. Its content key includes the raw artifact size and SHA-256,
format, and expected executable path, size, and SHA-256, so distinct
transformations of the same raw bytes never alias and a valid immutable entry
is never replaced. Install validates the current tenon compatibility interval,
host platform, source ownership, archive containment, raw identity, prepared
executable identity, and every closed capability before atomically replacing
the small installation-state record under a store lock. It never executes a
package. Cache bytes published before an interruption are inert until an exact
valid installation state selects them.

Inspection and verification are separate: inspect can report the immutable
non-secret manifest and installed identities without opening a process, while
offline verify rehashes the raw artifact and every prepared file. Disable
prevents future resolution. Enable first verifies. Remove deletes only the
exact installation record and deliberately retains shared content-addressed
bytes. A separate non-secret consumption receipt may bind agent identity and
selected capability ids to the exact current manifest for diagnostics; it
contains no workspace, executable, or environment value and grants no trust.
Broad cache garbage collection remains deferred.

The offline lookup verifies enabled state, compatibility, artifact closure,
and executable identity, then returns defensive package metadata plus exact
prepared paths. A capability consumer supplies the artifact ids from its own
closed schema. Generic selective staging copies only those verified ids to the
canonical package/manifest/artifact prefix. The installer does not infer MCP,
credential, policy, confirmation, or process behavior from them. The
native-MCP consumer may derive a credential-free, harness-targeted launch
descriptor containing the exact executable, literal arguments and defaults,
working directory, ambient variable names, startup, and trust metadata. It
does not resolve ambient values, start the process, select authored source, or
write Claude or Codex configuration; native configuration generation is the
connection and apply journey's responsibility.

## Context

Vendored Agent Plugins under authored `plugins/` are portable project source.
Their skills and native MCP declarations remain useful, but their download,
installation, and update model is deliberately outside
[ADR 0009](0009-import-vendored-agent-plugin-skills.md) and ADR 0010.
Machine-installed integration executables need different trust, provenance,
reuse, and staging ownership and must not be confused with that
authored-source model.

The official GitHub MCP server illustrates the dependency problem. Importing a
vendor implementation into tenon's root module couples releases and grows the
trusted in-process dependency graph. A universal plugin runtime would replace
that coupling with an unbounded dynamic authority surface. A metadata envelope
plus narrow process contracts preserves ordinary binary performance and lets
operators add exact integrations without rebuilding tenon.

## Consequences

- A credentialless native-MCP fixture and the official `github-mcp-server`
  executable metadata install, validate, and select through the same
  vendor-neutral envelope without sharing a capability runtime.
- An unknown capability type or version is rejected without reading or
  executing its artifact.
- Root tenon dependencies remain independent of package SDKs.
- Local and pinned-HTTPS installation, shared immutable cache, offline lookup,
  enablement, and selective staging use the same common envelope without
  learning MCP runtime semantics.
- Vendored Agent Plugins and their native MCP generation remain unchanged.
- Registry search, git/npm/Go installers, package scripts, automatic updates,
  signatures, remote HTTP MCP, credentials and OAuth, arbitrary hooks, and
  in-process plugins remain deferred.
