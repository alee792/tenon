# ADR 0003: Separate agent source from workspace

- Status: accepted
- Re-records: prototype ADR 0005 (alee792/hctl)

## Decision

Treat an agent project as portable authored source that can be applied to any
independently selected workspace. The agent source contains authored project
files such as instructions, skills, tools, subagents, harness-specific files,
connections, schedules, plugins, and native dependency files. The workspace
contains generated harness files, apply records, dispatch state, runtime
caches, and the files on which the harness and authored tools operate.

`--workspace` defaults to the agent source directory, preserving a simple
standalone-agent journey. Using an agent stored in another project or shared
location requires an explicit workspace. Directory placement, including being
a child of an `agents/` directory, never implicitly selects the parent
repository as the workspace.

## Context

An agent definition may live beside other agent definitions, inside the
repository it maintains, or in a separate reusable project. Inferring its
operating workspace from its storage layout couples portable behavior to one
repository convention and makes native `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and MCP
inheritance surprising.

Keeping source and workspace explicit also supplies the composition seam used
by the staged filesystem contract in
[ADR 0012](0012-stage-agent-filesystems-for-downstream-oci-builds.md). OCI
image construction and deployment remain outside tenon's boundary.

## Consequence

Apply and headless run commands must carry both source and workspace identity.
Generated MCP commands must preserve both paths so runtime verification loads
the selected source against the correct workspace record. Authored language
dependencies are resolved from agent source, while tool calls use the workspace
as their process working directory.

When tenon stages an agent, immutable source and the generated workspace occupy
separate canonical paths. Runtime-owned workspace paths remain writable without
making authored source mutable.

This boundary controls native configuration discovery and default working
context; it is not a security sandbox. Tenon does not claim that Claude Code or
Codex native tools cannot access paths outside the workspace.
