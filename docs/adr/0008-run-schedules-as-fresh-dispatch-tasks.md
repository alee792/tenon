## Plain-English summary

An agent author can add a Markdown schedule whose path is its name, whose
frontmatter contains one cron string, and whose body is the task prompt. Apply
validates and fingerprints that source without starting a clock. An operator
can dispatch one occurrence through the durable turn dispatcher, but every
accepted occurrence starts a fresh native-harness session so recurring work
does not silently inherit old model context. The supplied input ID makes
retries deduplicatable. Automatic clocks, deployment registration, output
delivery, and per-turn deadline policy are separate from validation and
fingerprinting;
[ADR 0011](0011-run-schedules-from-a-foreground-utc-clock.md) supplies the
foreground UTC clock through a shared task runtime.

## Decision

Root-agent schedules use Eve's Markdown convention at
`schedules/NESTED/NAME.md`. The relative path without `.md` is the schedule
name. Frontmatter contains exactly one string field named `cron`; it must be a
bounded, standard five-field printable-ASCII expression. The non-empty Markdown
body is the prompt; matching Eve, only one optional blank line after the
closing frontmatter delimiter is removed. Apply discovers a bounded number of
schedules, validates their real paths and bounded contents, and includes their
original bytes in the source fingerprint. It starts no harness process, clock,
or external registration.

`tenon schedule trigger AGENT NAME --input-id ID` submits one prompt through
the typed dispatch seam. A stable dispatcher conversation derived from the
schedule name retains bounded outcome history for deduplication, but task mode
opens the native harness without a resume ID for every accepted input. It
clears the stored native session ID after a terminal result. A crash can still
retain the active session ID long enough for dispatcher recovery to classify
the occurrence as uncertain; it is never silently retried.

The command reports only the schedule name, input ID, lifecycle status,
duplicate flag, and available native runtime IDs. It discards model text.
Completed duplicates return the prior status without opening a harness. Any
non-completed terminal status produces a nonzero command result after its
status line is written.

The `cron` value is parsed as a standard expression at validation; only the
foreground clock of ADR 0011 evaluates it in UTC with its overlap behavior.
Trigger accepts an operator-selected task-turn deadline independent of the
command's bounded whole-process timeout. Expiry aborts that task process and
completes the durable occurrence as uncertain, with a separate bounded
`deadline_exceeded` reason. The stable input ID therefore returns that
classified result instead of replaying it, while a later occurrence still
opens a fresh session.

## Context

Eve treats a Markdown schedule as task mode: the file carries one five-field
cron value and a prompt, each occurrence gets its own session, and model output
is discarded. Tenon does not own a hosted runtime, so the first useful slice is
portable source plus explicit one-shot dispatch. Reusing the durable turn
dispatcher preserves its input validation, acceptance, deduplication, terminal
outcomes, and uncertain restart recovery without inventing a second scheduler
state store.

One durable conversation per occurrence would also create unbounded
conversation records. A stable conversation per schedule plus fresh native
sessions keeps deduplication bounded by the dispatcher's recent-outcome limit
while preserving task isolation.

## Consequences

- Schedules are root-only because subagents accept `instructions.md` only.
- Nested names come directly from their bounded UTF-8 relative paths; tenon
  does not impose a model-tool identifier grammar on them.
- Changing a schedule invalidates the applied setup through the source
  fingerprint, but it does not require native-session migration.
- One-shot dispatch is local and explicit. It performs no delivery, network
  registration, missed-run replay, daemon installation, or schedule overlap
  management.
- TypeScript schedule handlers and Eve's hosted authenticated runtime remain
  unsupported.
- The dispatcher keeps only bounded recent outcomes, so deduplication is not
  an unbounded execution ledger.
